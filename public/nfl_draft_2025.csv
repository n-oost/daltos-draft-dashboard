R.,Player,Position,School,Notes
1,Travis Hunter,CB/WR,Colorado,"Unbelievable athlete.  Perfect footwork, fluid hips.  Glides effortlessly.  Matches WRs well, recovers fast.  Playing both sides of the ball seems to lend to mirroring ability, knows what WRs want to do at different depths.  Thin but willing tackler.  Gets his nose in on a play.  Smart as a whip.  Reads the field and makes an intelligent decision instead of just shooting on athletic ability.  Plays all game on both sides of the ball and never seems to tire out.  Can probably slot him in on man or zone.  Wants to play WR and will be perfectly fine at it at the NFL level.  X receiver with some decent routes and good hips.  Great hands.  Made some tough catches, took some big hits.  Plays with polish and fluidity.  Limited a bit to less complex routes, more of a sprinter or slant guy.  Kind of worried about hits taken and tackles he does, may not last forever playing like that.  Too good sometimes, jumps routes at the wrong time and has to recover.  Recovers fast though.  Mirroring is a bit too loose.  Dinged up a lot, took an unlucky injury against Colorado State but hurt a lot besides that."
2,Mason Graham,DL,Michigan,"Absolute pass rush technician.  Amazing hand placement.  Gets great leverage and wrestles through blocks.  Elite first step.  Really hard to stay in front of.  Has some pass rush moves, decent swim and bull rush.  Deploys a spin every now and then that has great potential.  Can line up anywhere.  Not really a run defender although can do it if on only one blocker.  Doesn't handle double teams that well, becomes just a guy.  Benefitted from stacked DL that took double teams off him.  Not really a tackler, has long arms but misses wrap ups.  "
3,Will Johnson,CB,Michigan,"Tall, all around outside CB.  Physical and strong.  Chucks guys, plays big.  Bully on the ball.  Good timing, good vertical jump on contested catches.  Has a great punch and rips arms on catches well.  Great hips and footwork.  Mirrors well, sticks to guys like glue.  Fantastic man corner.  Could probably slot into zone due to acceleration.  Okay in zone.  Generally smart so doesn't really get hurt in either coverage, just not a very good tackler.  A little slow top end speed.  Gambles too much.  Has a reputation as a big return INT guy so he tries to break on routes unrealistically.  Really physical in coverage to a fault.  Two bad injuries to the same leg.  Plays tiny in the run game."
4,Cam Ward,QB,Miami,"Improvisational QB.  FCS allstar before going to WSU and Miami.  Non traditional, heavy pocket movement.  Tries to keep plays alive until clear windows open.  Great arm.  Throws from a variety of slots and always seems to have zip on it.  Surprisingly nice touch for mechanics, seems to have most of the throwing motion in his shoulder despite different arm slots.  Smooth, gliding motion.  Ball gets out of his hand fast once he starts his release.  Reads the LOS well and knows where pressure is coming from.  Pure gamer, just patient and calm, not afraid of blitzers.  Good movement in the pocket to create incidental contact.  Strong, sheds tackles.  Decent runner.  Really nice thrower on the run too.  Just passed all over everyone, had great receivers and RB, pretty crummy OL.  Not all OL's fault for sacks, plays around way too much and misses open lanes.  Much better when he just rips it sometimes.  A little too patient at times and defaults to a backpedal which avoids the sack but kills any chance of making a play.  Lots and lots of mesh and easy flares, still hit hard throws but in a pretty potent spread offense.  Makes some bone headed throws when trying to do heroics.  Footwork mechanics are non existent and would probably be very bad to fix, lives or dies by his arm."
5,Tetairoa McMillan,WR,Arizona,"Tall high pointer.  Designed to just go up and get the ball.  Tracks the ball well for a tall guy, creates a big target.  Huge catch radius.  Great hands, hard to pop the ball out.  Can line up anywhere and run a variety of routes even if he's not the best at it.  Prime example of can't teach size.  Pretty smart and can pick apart zones although he tends to cut off routes.  Potent in the red zone.  Huge production and game changer for his offense with a tiny, crappy QB.  Creates zero separation and isn't going to outrun anyone.  Tries hard in route running but just isn't good at it.  Can get yards after the catch but goes down too easy for someone his size.  Strength seems to be all upper body."
6,Armand Membou,OT,Missouri,"Powerful RT.  Very aggressive finisher.  Powerful hands, not that big but ruins people.  Pretty smart.  Processes the game fast, picks up delayed rushes well.  Decently fluid for his size.  Moves well in the run game and can carry guys on his hip, has some pulling and second level blocking ability.  Doesn't waste a lot of effort getting into position and is generally in his spot faster than edges.  Built powerfully, shorter for a tackle but stout with long arms.  Pretty decent leverage.  Gets wide and sets well.  Hand timing can be a bit off.  Gets caught punching air.  Plodder.  Looks to set and thats it.  Might have to move into guard."
7,Josh Simmons,OT,Ohio State,"Fluid, powerful LT.  Fantastic footwork, glides around the field.  Gets to the second level fast.  Great bend and leverage.  Powerful, violent hands.  Punches bull rushes back.  Very explosive before the injury.  Not as explosive after the injury.  Kind of just punches in pass pro and needs to get better at reading the rush.  Fights rushers instead of disengaging and looking for a better block.  Good aggression, just overdoes it.  Knee injury is the kind you don't come back from with the same athleticism."
8,Will Campbell,OT,LSU,"Great pass pro.  Nice footwork.  Good recovery, smart, keeps up with shifty guys.  Pretty great leverage for height.  Bends well, good anchor.  Quick feet.  Finishes well, gets to the second level quickly.  Kind of does the same thing with his hands every time but does it well.  Shorter arms.  Sells out hard against speed rushers, seems to have trouble with them despite footwork.  Smoked Bamas guys last year but got destroyed by Dallas Turner the year before.  Gets off balance, doesn't read rips well and makes himself susceptible.  Just consistently good, might have go inside to guard."
9,Jihaad Campbell,LB,Alabama,"All around player with ideal size and speed.  Can cover with the best of them and rushes like an edge.  Explosive.  Hits blockers right in their chest and gets around them.  Has a few pass rush moves.  Active hands.  Fast in coverage.  Sticks with people well and has decent instincts.  Probably best on play side or just tracking TEs.  Raw still.  A bit sloppy even though he makes plays.  Athleticism causes him to overpursue or react rather than anticipate.  Plays too high, wastes some of his power off the edge or in the wash.  Shoulder surgery right after the combine."
10,Mike Green,Edge,Marshall,"All around pass rusher.  A bit short but doesn't let it affect his style of play with shorter arms but doesn't let it affect his play.  Amazing bend, just gets lower than blockers can handle and creates length that way.  Bunch of pass rush moves, nice chop and rips when stood up, really nice spin move.  Great twitch, doesn't let OTs get their hands on him easily.  Surprisingly decent run defender, tries hard and can stand people up with strength.  Pure gamer, finishes plays, goes full out dives to make tackles.  Kicked off of Virginia after suspension for sexual assault incident.  Tiny hands, short arms.  Just kinda goes off the snap and then reacts as the play goes on.  "
11,Carson Schwesinger,LB,UCLA,"Amazing blitzter.  Shoots gaps super fast and makes plays.  Diagnoses the play fast and intelligently for a one year wonder.  Athletic.  Sideline to sideline tackler.  Okay coverage ability, raw but tries when tasked with it.  More of a at the line player even though he lacks the length and strength to make a difference there.  Relies a lot on speed, doesn't really have pass rush moves or the ability to shed fast.  Pursuit angles are poor on the sidelines, way better inside the hashes.  Explosion tires out after a while and gap shooting becomes less effective."
12,Ashton Jeanty,RB,Boise State,"All world RB.  Great burst, speed, agility, and balance, all around package as a rusher.  Tackle breaking machine.  Shifty footwork and clever angles to create incidental contact.  Keeps feet churning.  Really smart, sees the field well at all levels.  Decently powerful and can knock defenders back.  Decent receiver and pass pro, not going to disappear on third down.  Absolutely ran into the ground.  Coach overused him to the point of concern.  Weaker competition, lots of arm tackles.  Fumbled and humbled against Penn State.  Powerfully built but still small, gets easily beaten by gang tackles.  Noticeably slower by the end of the season.  "
13,Abdul Carter,Edge,Penn State,"Top tier athlete, just flies around the field.  Great first step.  Very twitchy, hard to stay in front of.  Just gets into the backfield.  Smaller but really violent.  Doesn't get stood up easily, fights hard.  Plays low to the ground and quick, really good pop off of initial block.  Great at taking the corner.  Had trouble consistently beating larger OTs like Donovan Jackson and Aireontae Ersery.  Got his stats but still had trouble.  Incredibly raw, just runs forward.  Loses a ton of power with first step from poor hand placement.  Could be better at taking the corner, kind of goes too far, could cut in sooner.  "
14,Donovan Ezeiruaku,Edge,Boston College,"Pure pass rusher.  Amazing bend, amazing first step.  Really smart player.  Has a pass rush plan and deploys it.  Great finesse moves, gets thin or uses his long arms to get the corner.  Nasty spin move.  Doesn't quit on the play, fights throughout.  Diagnoses the backfield well, predicts the play.  Really thin.  Not going to set the edge or bullrush NFL OTs.  Great tackler but more of a chase guy down in the run game.  Not really explosive, more just a rangy athlete."
15,Colston Loveland,TE,Michigan,"Pure receiving threat.  Would be a WR in the 2000's.  Flies off the line.  Exceptional route runner, huge run after catch ability.  Great hands.  Tall and strong, pops DBs and doesn't go down easily.  Constantly breaks tackles.  Good contested catcher, just out lengths people, stays in strong on big hits.  Crummy blocker.  All upper body, stick legs.  Would be wasted there anyway.  "
16,Xavier Watts,Safety,Notre Dame,"Rangy free safety.  Converted WR and it shows.  Understands how to contest at the point of catch.  Punches hard and fights hard on jump balls.  Plays bigger than his size in run support.  Not the best tackler but puts his head down and spears people.  Really smart in zone.  Doesn't fall for anything at the top of routes.  Solid in man, sticks well and can make up the distance fast if he's late.  Just triggers and goes sometimes.  More speed than anything, not going to stick to the shiftier TEs in the NFL.  Loses his smarts in run defense and just attacks the pile.  Could probably be way better at diagnosing the running lane but still versatile enough to play in the box."
17,Matthew Golden,WR,Texas,"Bigger of the two Texas transfers that couldn't fix Ewers.  Consistently gets open.  Elite top end speed in game and at the combine.  Combines it with excellent footwork and saavy route running.  Absolutely punishing after the catch.  Explosive and super hard to catch from behind.  Really good returner.  Hurt his foot bad at Houston, nagging rib injuries at Texas.  Good contested catcher but more of a get open kind of guy despite size.  Lets himself get chucked at the line and tries to run through it instead of fight through it.  Doesn't try to block, seems to make business decisions.  "
18,Omarian Hampton,RB,UNC,"Tall, powerful RB.  Explosive, bursts through the line.  Strong and violent.  Quick twitch, wrenching runner that's hard to bring down.  Great balance.  Pretty patient at times, not just a blind one cut runner, willing to just lower the shoulder and pick up yards when nothing materializes.  Big but doesn't seek out contact.  Efficient and gets out into open space for the home run hit.  Pretty good pass protector.  Tries hard.  Decent receiver.  Soft hands, okay route runner.  Plays really tall and takes chest shots or gets upended.  Isn't going to make anyone miss in the open field, just runs straight forward.  Not really elusive or agile, more of a straight head of steam.  "
19,James Pearce Jr.,Edge,Tennessee,"Pure pass rusher.  Just wins on athleticism and length.  Blows past college OTs.  Explodes off the snap, times it great.  Decently smart, reads the backfield well and knows when to abandon the pass rush.  Good bend for how tall he is.  Doesn't just get stood up when his initial moves don't work, fights hard and moves his feet laterally to keep with the play.  Finishes plays and has some good chase down highlights.  Apparently crazy and a locker room nutcase but who knows.  Kind of too thin, needs to put on weight, gets pushed out of his rushing lanes.  Not going to set an edge with power.  Can get washed out on playside blocks."
20,Tyler Warren,TE,Penn State,"Huge, all around TE.  Lined up everywhere, ran every route.  Man among boys type receiver.  Out jumps and out muscles everyone.  Really hard to bring down after the catch.  Great balance and strength.  Used in gadget wildcats due to athleticism.  Surprisingly good at creating separation, doesn't always win just on size.  Decently fast and has good top end speed.  Kind of slow in and out of breaks, isn't going to take the cap off a defense either.  Can be neutralized pretty effectively by playing 10 yards off when lined outside.  Okay enough run blocker.  Could do better, kind of shoves more than using his length.  Turns his body to the QB too much on play actions."
21,Mykel Williams,Edge,Georgia,"Supreme run defender.  Huge and uses his size well.  Tosses people.  Very long arms with heavy hands.  Mans gaps well, intelligent in the run game.  Surprising leverage and quickness for height.  Wins with power.  No pass rush moves to speak of.  Just looks to swim over blockers and get into the backfield.  Very effective at it but no technique.  Kind of lumbers off the snap, could be quicker.  Hand placement is bad, goes too wide in run defense and doesn't use his length on passing downs.  Big ceiling but raw as hell."
22,Shedeur Sanders,QB,Colorado,"Pocket QB with exceptional arm talent.  Cannon with accuracy.  Can make any throw on the field with zip.  Leads receivers open, knows the game and has good feel.  Smart in general, ran a simplistic air raid but made good decisions.  Really quick release, ball explodes out of his hand.  Great footwork when setting, smooth and transfers power well.  Had to pull off some heroics behind a terrible OL that gave him no time.  Pretty decent runner, can get extra yards on dead plays.  Keeps his eyes down field and isn't afraid to make tough timing throws.  Got beat up extra hard because of his notoriety, took some big hits in the Alamo Bowl and throughout the season.  Takes big hits in general, seems to have the pocket presence and mobility to dodge them but just ends up getting plastered.  Heroic throws but also heroic plays by his WRs.  Back pedals like a Madden player, sometimes without a need to.  Running style and pocket style will lead to injuries.  Not every sack was on the OL, need to make big play causes him to look off open guys underneath.  Throws hospital balls that will get someone killed one day."
23,Derrick Harmon,DL,Oregon,"One year wonder but dominated.  Tall, powerful, great burst.  One of the better bull rushes in the draft.  Creates great length and push.  Great stack and shed.  Great awareness.  Knows when to disengage and get into the lane.  Powerful tackler, sticks people.  Really hard to keep hands on him, gets thin and sheds well.  Wears out as the game goes on, loses violent rush and becomes more of a gap sitter.  All upper body, little chicken legs.  Tough as hell and tries to beat the guy in front of him sometimes instead of making the play.  Often the clean up guy on a stacked line.  "
24,Malaki Starks,Safety,Georgia,"Single high/box safety.  Super rangy.  Stood out making plays on a loaded Georgia defense, instant starter.  Snaps to the play.  Not the fastest guy in the world but just fluid and quick.  Triggers fast and beats LBs to run plays.  Smart at the point of catch.  Good ball skills, gets pass break ups in bunches.  Is super aggressive, takes questionable angles to plays but seems to do it because LBs and edges manned their gaps really well.  Not really a man coverage guy.  Hips are fine but just doesn't have the knack.  Could stand to have more zone discipline when a play action is coming to his side."
25,Luther Burden III,WR,Missouri,"Elite short yardage guy.  Operated pretty much only out of the slot and on quick routes.  Gets off the line fast and takes people with his footwork.  Useful at all levels of the field, great top end speed to run deep routes and has great tracking ability.  Meat and potatoes YAC guy that turns up field immediately after the catch and picks up tons of yards.  Tries hard in blocking and can actually do some work.  Huge down year after teams figured out Brady Cook and Mizzou leaned on a 25 year old average RB.  All his routes were designed to take advantage of the YAC after the passing game died.  Tough but gets chucked at times in possession catches."
26,Jahdae Barron,CB,Texas,"Versatile zone corner.  Fantastic physicality.  Forced to play everywhere and make tackles downhill.  Quick trigger.  Great IQ in zone, just reads guys well and breaks as the ball is in the air.  Fast and explosive.  Can keep up with most routes in man, just better in zone.  Tries hard in the run game.  Takes on blockers and makes willing tackles, can play close to the line and hot blitz.  Not the greatest at reading man routes, seems to be more comfortable sitting back.  Handsy in drag routes or when he has to play over a receivers shoulder.  Tackles are often with his shoulder and diving at the legs in run support.  Not the greatest at fighting around blockers but is also a CB so it's excusable, just not as good at run support as tackles imply.  Kind of stiff at times.  Plays the slot but doesn't seem that comfortable doing it.  "
27,Emeka Egbuka,WR,Ohio State,"High floor slot WR.  Runs crisp routes, picks up yards after the catch.  Top tier cutting ability.  Good combo of head fakes and footwork to get open.  Concentrates on the catch well and keeps his hips pointed up field.  Kept going back to college for some unknown reason.  Never the #1 on his own team, not really an outside WR either.  Barely tried in run blocking but not really his responsibility or game.  Not exceptionally fast or strong and can get bumped off routes."
28,Andrew Mukuba,Safety,Texas,"Incredibly fluid for a safety.  Elite hips, change of direction, speed.  Flies across the field.  Really smart, sniffs out plays fast, doesn't waste time in coverage on run plays or fall for play actions.  Stick thin but more than willing in run support.  Hits like a truck somehow.  Can line up anywhere, nickle corner versatility.  Kinda meh in man coverage, has the athleticism to do it but not the knack.  Bites in zone coverage a bit too fast and can let people by him.  Tackling form is either poor or timid when he's not lowering his shoulder.  Needs to just take an extra step and wrap up instead of going for diving feet tackles.  Really thin."
29,T.J. Sanders,DL,South Carolina,"Three tech gap shooter.  Great first step when it's working.  Shoots fast, gets inside pads and fights hard.  Can't arm fight him.  Tall and uses length to display elite pass rushing package.  Raw, lots of potential.  Technically sound and shows a lot of maturity for experience.  Needs to work on utilizing his athleticism.  Sloppy off the snap, kind of awkward footwork wastes raw power that flashes.  Doesn't try or gets tired as the game goes on.  Doesn't really finish the play, kind of eases off if he sees he's too far from the QB.  Doesn't try against the run at all or isn't good at it.  Too many arm tackles.  "
30,Damien Martinez,RB,Miami,"Big, fire hydrant back.  Operated primarily out of shotgun.  Good behind the LOS, decisive and finds a lane through good footwork.  Short area twitchiness, adjusts his body well in the wash.  Strong, lowers the shoulder and gets extra yards.  Decent blocker.  Big, tries hard, fights well.  Good feet churn on contact.  Can turn up field and explode fast although has limited top end speed.  Decently elusive, has good nuanced movement to slip contact.  Pretty good receiver, good hands, good body control.  Always jumps behind the line, never seems to just go forward.  Never seems to bounce to the outside and tries to exclusively work blocking gaps.  Lots of flash, goes down to a good wrap up.  Pass blocking is more throw a shoulder than elite for the position.  Got to run against mostly empty boxes but still okay when presented with a heavier front, just not a lot of pro set tape."
31,Nick Emanwori,Safety,South Carolina,"Probably the best athlete in the draft.  Tall and big, moves great for his size.  Great in coverage and run support.  Sticky in man coverage, way better at it than zone.  Good hips and footwork.  Really good tackler, tries hard and wraps up well.  A little sloppy but just too big to make it matter.  Energetic, constantly around the ball.  Really good special teamer, gets downfield fast and makes great open field tackles.  Raw as hell despite starting three years.  Still seems tentative or maybe cumbersome when reacting to guys in his zone.  Doesn't really read the field, slow to react to run plays too but triggers fast enough that it doesn't matter.  "
32,Tyler Booker,OL,Alabama,"Powerful left guard.  Length and size inside with supreme anchor.  Blocks like a tackle inside, creates length and out muscles tackles.  Patient hands and great footwork on the initial block.  Violent and tough but not over aggressive.  Waits and reads the play before engaging, often used in wider sets and on islands with Kadyn Proctor while Bama did max protect on the strong side.  Pretty decent footwork when moving, can pull well.  Can't move beyond that.  Very slow, used in space but didn't really do much.  Leans forward and falls flat on his face in run blocking.  Sets arms too wide in run blocking.  Loses his power.  Over reliant on catch blocking and can get taken by shiftier DTs.  "
33,Nic Scourton,Edge,Texas A&M,"Big boy with a ton of pop.  Plays way bigger than his size.  Man handles blockers.  Long arms, heavy hands, rips people around.  Never quits and keeps the legs churning.  Can flatten blockers.  Went to the Aggies from Purdue and got fat.  Lost his first step, rumbles into guys now.  Plays way too high when he's doing run defense.  No bend, all power.  Has a ton of different pass rush moves but doesn't have a plan for when he gets stood up.  Plants his feet and forgets to go forward, focuses too much on hand fighting.  "
34,Jayden Higgins,WR,Iowa State,"Tall WR, big catch radius.  Really smooth athlete.  Fast top end speed and can run short yardage routes, has the footwork to do it.  Snatches balls out of the air.  Great high pointer and jumping off the sprint.  Smart, finds open spots quick.  Tracks the ball great, doesn't waste a lot of movement getting under the ball.  Total softie.  Lets people pop him and get into his catch radius.  Doesn't really fool anyone on his routes."
35,Kenneth Grant,DL,Michigan,"Can't teach size nose tackle.  Really powerful.  Moves anyone when he gets down hill.  Quick first step for someone his size.  Nice footwork.  Big hands, powerful and can move blockers.  Good tackler, processes fast and gets into a lane.  Surprisingly good pass rush moves.  Inconsistent after he gets tired and gets tired fast.  Loses pad level and starts playing too high, gets lazy with hand placement.  Overrated movement skills, not that fast.  Tries but just seems to wear out as the play goes on despite the one highlight where he chased a RB down from behind.  Tall with long arms but plays close to his chest, doesn't create length."
36,Demetrius Knight Jr.,LB,South Carolina,"Everything you want in a LB.  Great instincts, fast, powerful.  Plays with a great pad level.  Drops back and recognizes plays, shoots on them fast.  Powerful.  Hits OL and pops them.  Can knock the helmet off people on hits.  Really good gap fitter.  Shoots them well or can man them in the run game.  Old as hell, already 25.  A bit stiff, limited in man coverage.  Could probably do better wrapping up than laying the hit stick every time.  First step is great if he's shooting the gap but slow on play recogition."
37,Jalon Walker,LB/Edge,Georgia,"Tweener edge/LB.  Played real close to the line and was the point of attack play maker on a potent defense.  Low pad level, gets into the gap and becomes a menace.  Decent recognition with great closing speed.  Powerful.  Takes on blockers well and sheds them.  Hard to stay in front of at times.  Sticks throughout a play and doesn't give up.  Decent coverage ability but more of a clean up guy and opportunist when he drops back.  Young and raw.  More of just a length fighter when he gets engaged than a pure pass rusher which might limit his tweener ability.  A bit too patient at times, lots of plays were due to Georgia's coverage behind him.  "
38,Trey Amos,CB,Mississippi,"Sticky man corner.  Tall and fluid.  Good hips for height, doens't get caught flat footed, can somewhat keep up with shiftier guys.  Mirrors well.  Good in contested catches that he can see.  Uses length to slap hands at the point of the catch.  Chucks guys, bully at the line.  Pretty good trigger in zone.  Tackles like a safety.  Pretty explosive and blows up blocks in run defense.  Going to be a flag machine.  Doesn't get his head around on the ball, just shoves people.  Grabby.  Bad predictor, keeps up through athleticism rather than reading the receiver.  Doesn't seem to matter due to athleticism since he can easily recover.  Just susceptible to digs or whenever he has his back to the ball.  Seems like he's still learning even though he has a bunch of experience.  "
39,Grey Zabel,OL,North Dakota State,"Tall guy tweening between guard and tackle.  Dominated the senior bowl.  Superb leverage ability.  Bends great at knees and waste.  Smart as heck.  Played against weaker competition but appeared to snuff out everything they were doing.  Patient on the punch in pass pro.  Mobile.  Great puller and second level blocker.  Nice footwork and kick off the snap.  Good hip mobility.  Fights okay at the point of attack, won more on length than sheer strength.  Kind of mediocre getting to the corner, shuffles more than slides.  Not that great against more shifty rushers.  Might have to move inside to guard but is very tall and not that violent.  Sets arms too wide in the run game and lacks a powerful punch to move guys."
40,Tre Harris,WR,Ole Miss,"Big and strong.  Great contested catcher.  Very strong blocker, technically sound and willing.  Good red zone threat, gets open has a good high point.  Decently explosive off the line.  Doesn't have good top end speed but can get to his spot reasonably fast for his size.  Not really agile, kinda stiff.  Ran a limited route tree, didn't look good in basic routes like slants.  Hurt a lot."
41,Walter Nolen,DL,Ole Miss,"Monster when he's clicking.  Powerful first step with violence behind it.  Can absolutely take guards.  Super fast and agile.  Long, powerful.  Hunts the backfield and makes plays.  Incredibly raw.  Pass rush moves are there but not technically sound.  Awful hand placement, completely random.  Gets took by traps and pulls, doesn't keep his head up and just focused on the guard in front of him.  Washed out by double teams.  Needs a lot of polish"
42,TreVeyon Henderson,RB,Ohio State,"Three down RB.  Great speed and power.  Runs fast and with great burst.  Flies through the line when he gets a lane.  Very elusive.  Bounces around, shifty, great start and stop speed.  Can lower the shoulder and deliver a hit if he can't lose a tackle.  Good agility, changes directions fast, corrects to keep body towards end zone.  Great pass blocker for size, gets low and fights hard.  Really good receiver.  Fluid, nice hands, not tasked with overly complicated routes but worked hard.  Hurt all the time and OSU recruited Judkins to split the backfield.  Instantly bounces behind the line regardless of what's presented in front of him.  Needs to learn to just cut up field.  Smarter LBs just stick him when he's trying to be shifty, more flash and footwork than substance breaking tackles.  Good size but still small and can lose yards against bigger defender wrap ups."
43,Marcus Mbow,OL,Purdue,"Squat RT.  Pure technician.  Comes out of the snap quick and places hands quick.  Smart player.  Not really flashy and very subtle in his blocking technique, knows how to break down arm fights and neutralize more violent rushers.  Reads the defense well, moves well with the timing of the play.  Pretty good kick slide, gets to the corner quick.  Pops guys and puts them off balance.  Good swat against more handsy rushers.  Finishes well in the run game, plays bigger than he is.  Pretty quick out in space, gets to the second level fast, finds blocks and is effective with them.  Good footwork.  Strength comes from tenacity rather than pure top level strength.  Might be too weak to kick inside and too short to play outside.  Plays really upright but from ability rather than lack of technique but might get punished by rushers at the next level.  Gets handsy when he jumps forward in run blocking and wraps blitzers."
44,Donovan Jackson,OL,Ohio State,"Versatile OL, primarily a LG but converted to LT after Josh Simmons patella tear.  Solid, all around player.  Great bend and anchor.  Sets great and plays bigger than he is due to technique.  Catches well.  Times his punch well.  Great leverage out of his stance, maintains power well, let him play at LT better than guards should.  Put up an admirable effort against Penn State's DL.  FIghts hard throughout the play.  Doesn't really do anything wrong as a guard but has noticeable deficiencies as a tackle.  Slow off the snap.  Corners slow.  Too slow with his left hand against speed rushers and gets taken to the outside easily.  Technique changes when he's a guard and becomes more disciplined and polished.  "
45,Kelvin Banks Jr.,OT/OL,Texas,"Shorter LT but built powerfully.  Squat, bowling ball like blocker.  Lands hands well, fights hard and violently in power sets.  Pretty decent leverage, good knees, good feet.  Moves well.  Can take rushers on the shoulder and move them in run sets.  Decently fast getting to the second level.  In a rinky dink offense that didn't really test his blocking skills.  Bends at his waist instead of his knees.  Kind of average against speed rushers to the point of concern.  Smart but only tasked with easy zone blocks, might need to prove he has a better swivel to pick up delayed rushes and more complex blitz packages.  Might just be a guard, kind of disappointing."
46,Femi Oladejo,LB/Edge,UCLA,"Tweener edge.  Very fast, great motor.  Never quits on a play.  Long arms and really strong for his size.  Great bend, naturally fluid.  Fights hard when he gets stood up, not easy to stay in front of.  Surprisingly good against the run.  Gets his nose in and makes plays.  Tackle machine, should probably just go back to linebacker but could cap out as an elite edge if he develops pass rush moves.  No pass rush moves, kind of just wins on leverage and speed.  Fast but slow off the snap, probably not used to it.  Gets caught flat footed against more complex run blocking schemes, should just trigger and go."
47,Dylan Sampson,RB,Tennessee,Smooth RB.  Runs smart and with savviness.  Creative.  Likes to flow with plays with sudden burst to worm through traffic.  Great out of the backfield.  Should have been used in the pass game more.  Moves on a dime.  Could probably split out into the slot.  Tiny and gets punked.  Powerfully built but just gets enveloped when being patient in the wash.  Not a pass blocker.  Should just run forward sometimes.  
48,Alfred Collins,DL,Texas,"Massive human being.  Can't move him at the point of attack.  Plays like an old man and is already 24.  Very disciplined.  Sticks to the gap and plays conservative.  Just tosses guys.  Really tall with long arms and great bend.  Commands double teams and deals with them well.  Really good at swatting passes, not just bulk.  Not a pass rusher.  Can get down hill but it takes a while.  Only really good at covering one gap and can't really move around after the snap.  Has a good motor but only so fast."
49,Benjamin Morrison,CB,Notre Dame,"All around outside corner.  Smart, fluid athlete.  Sticky as hell.  Primarily played outside but can easily cover slot guys and shiftier WRs.  Presses well, mirrors well coming off the line.  Snuffs out routes.  Stays inside the receivers pocket and plays physically.  Good in zone too.  Triggers well, tackles well.  Ball hawk and INT machine.  Just baits well, tormented Caleb Williams sophomore year.  Kind of slight.  Press doesn't always work on bigger WRs.  Kind of handsy.  Bump and run style borders on PI.  Scary hip surgeries and shoulder surgery.  Can get took by double moves and stop and go WRs.  Tries too hard to stick to receivers instead of just predicting their route sometimes.  Seems to get visibily frustrated during games where he's getting ran against."
50,Shavon Revel Jr.,CB,East Carolina,"Tall, springy zone corner.  Fast and strong, great length.  Presses with long arms, good recovery out of it.  Generally on the sidelines in deep zone but often tasked with sprinting into that quarter.  Had to display constant acceleration and top end speed.  Pretty good in contested catches.  Gets his body in position, uses height and size to bully.  Great ball skills.  Meets the receiver up high and has good timing.  Plus tackler.  Good up close to the line.  Bad ACL tear.  Old.  In a gimmick defense that let him gamble a lot.  Terrible mirroring ability.  Seems raw as hell.  Flat footed when keeping up with shifty receivers.  Often trailing hard out of press and probably not just due to scheme.  Presses guys but they just run under it, has his butt too far back when he does it.  Probably should just swap to safety."
51,Gunnar Helm,TE,Texas,"All around TE.  Very fluid athlete, fast and agile.  Runs crisp routes, good hips and footwork.  Shields great.  Uses size and long arms.  Really good body control in the air.  Plus blocker.  Uses length and footwork in pass pro.  Production flourished after grad transfer WRs came in.  Raw as hell.  Run blocking is cumbersome and without any pop.  Needs to put on weight.  Ran only a couple of routes, often dump offs or quick hits in the seam.  "
52,Quinshon Judkins,RB,Ohio State,"Primary back and more of the early down work horse in the OSU backfield pairing.  Really good in short area.  Runs twitchy and shifty.  Big and powerful, very strong and explosive.  Just finds the hole, patient and reads LBs well.  Fire hydrant build.  Good receiver, gets the ball and gets upfield fast.  Quick feet.  Good goal line back, hunts the end zone.  Keeps the ball high and tight, good contact balance and stiff arm.  Kind of slow and not as strong as he should be.  Lost third down reps to smaller back due to crappy pass protection.  Gets intimidated when holes close up and stutters behind the line.  "
53,Jordan Burch,DL,Oregon,"Super fast and explosive.  Transfers his power great from his burst into upper body.  Great tackler.  Sticks people.  Fights hard throughout the play.  Lines up all over the DL.  Not a gap minder.  Doesn't really have technique yet, just raw athleticism.  Poor hand placement, can't really disengage and gets himself tangled.  Looks to burst through a line instead of looking into the backfield."
54,Mason Taylor,TE,LSU,"Big receiver.  Great hands.  Snatches balls.  Zone stretcher.  Great at seam routes and longer developing horizontal routes.  Agile, great athlete.  Lowers the shoulder after the catch and gets extra yards, usually has to get cut low to get brought down by DBs.  Big guy but gets bullied off routes and in contested catches.  Doesn't block that well.  Tries but isn't very good at it.   Ran a lot of similar f drags behind the line when in line, kind of hidden in the blocking scheme too. "
55,Cobee Bryant,CB,Kansas,"All around corner.  Used equally in zone and man, great at both.  Great hips and feet.  Mirrors well, recovers well.  Twitchy.  Great body control in general.  Very good in press.  Gets up tight, pops people despite size, makes the first five difficult.  Good predictor and experienced, smart.  Great ball skills.  Long and can punch and compete at the point of catch.  Really good in zone.  Triggers fast, sticks people.  Smart and doens't hesitate.  Good in run support.  Fights hard, big enough to chuck WR blocks and make the play.  Stick thin and probably drank milkshakes to up his weight at the combine.  Flag machine.  Gambles hard, tries to make the play on the ball instead of the receiver.  Needs help over the top."
56,Jalen Royals,WR,Utah State,"4.4 at the combine but feels like he plays faster than that in game.  Explosive.  Lines up everywhere, good catcher, good frame.  Deadly after the catch.  Punishing.  Smart route runner, good at finding spots and exploiting it.  Adjusts well.  Had two crummy QBs throwing to him and he still produced.  Runs a couple of routes and not very crisp while doing it.  Snatches the ball but takes his eye off it a lot, looks for the big play.  Hardest matchup he had was like BJ Mayes."
57,Jaylin Noel,WR,Iowa State,Fantastic release off the line.  Super quick feet.  Just gets open.  Can line up all over the field and run a bunch of different routes.  Snatches the ball.  Acceleration gets him into position for routes that make him a first down machine.  Cuts sharp.  Lulls DBs on his routes and can mix up speeds running similar routes depending on coverages.  Decent punt returner.  Built like a possession WR but easily jostled.  Lets DBs get inside his arms on contested catches.  Looks up field before catching the ball.
58,Jack Bech,WR,TCU,"Ideal possession WR.  Tall, strong.  Great shielding ability, boxes out well.  Strong arms, great at catching the ball through contact.  Fights through press coverage.  Gets up field after the catch and punishes DBs with size.  Terrible route runner but gets open somehow.  Just has the knack for it.  Skipped running the 40 at the combine for a reason.  Looks slow as hell."
59,Nohl Williams,CB/Safety,Cal,"Safety playing corner.  Best CB tackler in the class, just wraps and sticks people.  Bully at the line.  Presses well, good hips and footwork out of the press.  Good at zone or man.  Smart, just reads WRs well.  On the slower side but makes up for it with fluidity.  Bump and run cover guy.  Plays a bit shallow in zone and looks to take it to the receiver early, a bit more mirror in man.  INT machine.  Gambles hard.  One of the worst shuttles in the class, shows in his change of direction.  Kind of ponderous in general.  Ran a 4.5 40 but looks slower on the field.  Grabby.  Should just swap to safety."
60,Tyleik Williams,DL,Ohio State,"Powerful nose tackle but can move around the line.  Plays tough, fights hard through double teams and gets violent in stand off engagements.  Moves on a dime.  Smart player.  Gets into lanes and diagnoses plays well outside his gap assignment.  Gamer.  Just has the knack.  Kind of sloppy and inconsistent.  Plays like his hairs on fire rather than being disciplined.  Tries but can get washed out by double teams.  Loses his anchor sometimes due to footwork.  Rotated a lot, not sure if its conditioning or Ohio State's dpeth.  Tall with long arms but doesn't use it.  Lets guards get inside his chest.  Pad level gets bad at times."
61,Kaleb Johnson,RB,Iowa,"Tall, sprinting RB.  Great top end speed, flies in the open field.  One cut runner mostly, looks to lower the shoulder and go.  Decisive.  Doesn't waste a lot of time, finds a lane.  Mostly shotgun and high ace sets so gets full head of steam before hitting the LOS.  Gets pads low, bangs for extra yards.  Pretty good out of the backfield, gets to his position fast, makes the catch and turns up field.  Tons of energy and stamina, constantly at top end speed throughout the game.  Protects the ball like his life depends on it, never takes a risk with a stiff arm.  Tall and big but not that strong, can get easily wrapped up behind the LOS.  Hesitates when the open lane doesn't happen, tends to jump cut and waste time.  A little less elite burst when in more traditional pro sets.  Piss poor hips, just runs forward, no elusiveness.  Weaves when he runs like Forrest Gump.  Feet churn is too broad and doesn't hold up well in a stand up tackle.  Kind of a bad blocker, tries but just isn't very good at it."
62,Kevin Winston Jr.,Safety,Penn State,"Bigger of the two hard hitting Penn State safeties.  Rotated positions with Jaylen Reed a lot, served same purpose.  Tasked with more run defense and line play.  Pretty good at it.  Really good tackler.  Breaks down great and wraps up with long arms.  Can lay the shoulder and hit hard too.  Good zone guy although that seems more on athleticism than recognition.  Can't play man at all.  Raw as hell, doesn't really recognize the game around him.  Bad knee injury knocked him out for most of the year."
63,Billy Bowman Jr,Safety,Oklahoma,"Little missile.  Played all over the place and on special teams.  Really good man cover guy, sticks to TEs and WRs much bigger than him and fights hard.  Great ball skills, hawks well and has the speed to close fast to do it.  Nice hips and footwork for a safety, might be playing out of position.  Tries hard and is a bundle of energy.  Goes to blow people up with his shoulder instead of wrapping up, when he does he's tiny and not that great.  Bites on play actions a lot.  Not a zone guy, hesitates too much when people enter his area and reacts late.  Seems more at ease being aggressive or having a clear assignment."
64,Azareye'h Thomas,CB,Florida State,"Tall, sticky man corner.  Smooth athlete.  Great hips and footwork.  Mirrors well.  Great presser, physical in general.  Great off the snap, great reaction time to receivers initial move and has great lateral agility to keep up.  Nice back pedal with good flip.  Pretty decent ball skills even if he doesn't get picks or break ups, is a nuisance and doesn't give up easy catches.  Plays low with good bend and good trigger.  Reasonably good at zone but seemed to be used more in man.  Tries really hard in the run game.  Reasonable tackle skills for a CB.  Slow, first first ten yard DB only.  Grabs the receiver the second they go into a break."
65,Tory Horton,WR,Colorado State,"Tall sprinter.  Lanky build, not the longest arms but makes up for it with technique and size on contested catches.  Gets downfield fast, tracks the ball great.  Barely loses stride on over the shoulder catches.  Strong hands.  Doesn't really try to block despite his size.  Went back to a bum school for some unknown reason and mangled his knee.  Can get chucked at the line, a bit too timid."
66,D.J. Giddens,RB,Kansas State,"Two down back.  Pure runner.  Has the knack.  Blends power and speed.  Great hesitations and shiftiness.  Great balance.  One year wonder but displayed great vision for experience.  Not the greatest receiver and wasn't used like that.  Not a really good pass blocker.  Raw and inexperienced at it.  Poor pad level, gets a bit too high although it does seem to be part of his plus vision."
67,Ashton Gillotte,Edge,Louisville,"Smaller run defender.  Shorter and compactly built, explodes into blockers.  Incredible motor.  Always moving, plays like Tuli Tuipulotu.  Great pad level.  Neutralizes relatively short arms with leverage abilities.  Nice get off, good footwork and drive.  Good hand placement, gets into the chestplate.  Decently violent, more subdued but can chuck arms.  Really good press out of initial engagement.  Wrecked havoc in 2023, less production this year but still constantly in the backfield.  Does have some pass rush moves and can deploy them well.  More of a shift and go guy but has a rip and can stack.  Very good split move when getting double teamed.  Pretty calm in the wash, looks to set the lane rather than just trying to shoot into the lane.  Success comes from constant effort rather than overwhelming athleticism.  Only average lateral agility, needs the play in front of him to make it.  Can get hooked into his blocker.  Needs to be faster at shedding.  Over commits and can get caught out of position.  Isn't going to chase anyone down from behind.  Can get handled by longer OTs.  Not always the best at beating out the block to his play side but does flash brilliance."
68,Darius Alexander,DL,Toledo,"Do it all DT that does everything okay.  Really good first step and agility.  Moves on a dime.  Thick, strong DT.  Has a good bull rush and swim move.  Plays the run well and gets into lanes quick.  Decent tackler, good wrap up.  Can get to the QB quick.  Promising but already 25 years old and probably capped out.  Not that smart, gets took sometimes in the run game then gives up.  Pass rush is without direction, needs to point himself at the QB better."
69,Cody Simon,LB,Ohio State,Started off as a gap filler but became a lot better as the season went on.  Great run defender.  Triggers into the gap and blows up plays.  Surprisingly decent coverage abilities.  Not polished but tries hard.  Wrecked teams by himself in the playoffs with his blitzes.  Seems limited athletically to be a sideline to sideline guy.  Kind of just shoots and goes sometimes.  Not sure if that's by design or lack of play recognition.
70,Dorian Strong,CB,Virginia Tech,"Tall man corner.  Press technician.  Gets in and becomes a pure nuisance.  Mirrors well for a tall guy, good change of direction and footwork.  Tested a bit slow at the combine but much faster in game.  Good ball skills.  Attacks the point of catch, good hops and fights well.  Decent tackler.  Gets his nose into run plays, tries really hard.  Mediocre zone guy.  Just makes the tackle, doesn't really stop anyone.  Going to be a flag machine if he doesn't look back at the QB more.  Can get took on digs.  Shiftier guys can give him trouble in general."
71,Kyle Williams,WR,Washington State,"Great route runner, very saavy and knows how to break off perfectly from his routes.  Extremely polished in that regard.  Tracks the ball great.  Decently explosive despite combine numbers.  Great change of direction, loses no momentum, leads to huge YAC.  Can line up anywhere.  Tiny and old.  Easily bumped off routes and turned upfield."
72,Cameron Williams,OT,Texas,"Powerful RT with supreme torque.  Longarms, clamping hands.  Just gets his mitts on people and ruins them.  Punches hard, sends lighter edges back easily.  Waist and knee bender, sets and drives.  Great extension after initial block and keeps feet moving to create more space.  No playing time but very smart for lack of experience.  Doesn't over commit, patient and reads defenses well.  Wins every stand up fight like a wrestler, just wrenches rushers to the ground.  Just run past him.  No one taught him how to kick slide.  Cheated up on the line every passing down.  Sets too much to the inside and lets his left shoulder get taken by weaker rushers.  Can give up a lot of space before anchoring.  Right Guard until further notice."
73,Princely Umanmielen,Edge,Ole Miss,"Big pass rusher.  Great pass rush set.  Chains moves together and sets up blockers well.  Stronger than his weight.  Good pop.  Hunts the backfield and gets a ton of production.  Has the knack to be around the play.  Good footwork and doesn't waste a lot of time triggering when he sees an opportunity.  Decent run defender.  A bit slow and stiff.  Comes out of his stance high and loses leverage.  More of a straight line rusher, takes harder angles to the QB instead of taking the corner.  Not really violent, kind of just engages"
74,Jacob Parrish,CB,Kansas State,"All around corner.  Speed demon athlete playing DB.  Fantastic hips and footwork.  Some of the best in the class.  Great mirroring ability.  Raw but can just keep up from athleticism.  Insane hops for a small guy.  Can compete on high pointing.  Keeps up with head fakes and shoulder fakes.  Really good trigger in zone.  Not always great at picking up the route but rarely punished for it.  Versatile.  Lined up everywhere.  Tries really hard, active throughout the play.  More flash than effective in run support.  A little handsy when he falls behind, timing a bit poor at point of catch.  Looses stickiness by flipping his head everywhere during a play, needs to play more calm.  Looks raw as hell."
75,Lathan Ransom,Safety,Ohio State,"Great run defender, linebacker out of position.  Big presence.  Hits like a hammer.  Plays close to the LOS and sifts through the wash intelligently.  Good pop on OL, doesn't let himself get engaged.  Sheds well.  Hurt a lot, style of play isn't going to lead to durability.  Not really a cover guy.  Has a bit of ability there but definitely a box safety.  Sloppy tackler.  Bad breakdown, grasps too much.  Should just swap positions."
76,Aireontae Ersery,OT,Minnesota,"Tall LT.  Big presence.  Gets out of his stance decently quick and clamps guys.  Destroys in the run game, just a big wrecking ball.  Pretty smart.  Reads pass rushers intent well and reacts well.  Hard to move on bull rushes.  Great use of hands.  Knows when to strike and move on the initial punch.  Plays LT but definitely has to move to the right side.  Clamped Abdul Carter but just by being bigger than him.  Very stiff.  Oversets and gives up the inside easily.  Pad level is his height.  Needs to set wide becuase doesnt have the footwork to cross his body.  Just average ability to get to the corner, helped by fast hitting offense."
77,JT Tuimoloau,Edge,Ohio State,"Run defender with good pass rush upside.  Smart player.  Quick at identifying run lanes, probably does it presnap.  Really good spin move for a big guy.  Uses length well.  Great power, muscles people.  Good edge setter.  Mediocre off the snap, kinda slow.  Pad level is too high.  Loses his power with poor hand usage.  Needs to pop people better.  No bend on the edge despite sack totals.  Lots of play time but a bit raw in his athleticism.  Seems awkward when he has to get agile."
78,Darian Porter Jr.,CB,Iowa State,"Tall zone corner.  Former WR and track star, third fastest player at the draft, one of the best shuttles.  Special teams all star before becoming one year starter.  Not bad for limited experience, decent in zone coverage.  Keeps his head on a swivel, recognizes routes pretty well.  Breaks fast on the route.  Great hips and footwork for a tall guy.  Still slow but great for size.  Tries really hard.  Terrible at corner at the moment.  Can't tackle, can't press.  No idea how to cover in man.  Not good at point of catch yet.  Poor timing, poor anticipation.  All potential but already old, 25 by the time he's drafted."
79,Josh Conerly Jr.,OT,Oregon,"Great pass pro LT.  Processes the game fast.  Bends well, places hands well.  Very fluid kick step.  Gets out fast and great in screens or at the second level.  Wide base, sets and creates length.  Uses angles well to create distance on the initial rush, forces edges out wide.  Decent recovery ability.  Receives bull rushes well even if he gives up a lot of space, can set and keep fighting.  Can get caught in his footwork on shiftier guys.  Not that strong, just average.  Not really a run blocker at all.  Rushes to the corner instead of trying to be fluid with it even though he's capable of it.  A bit chicken legged, kind of narrow.  Can get handsy when he's beat around the edge and over extends his arms trying to recover instead of using footwork."
80,Emery Jones Jr.,OT,LSU,"Disciplined RT.  Thick, built like a fridge.  Hard to move south.  Anchors with good lean and bend.  Gets his hands inside pads, times his block well.  Smart and knows when to pick his block.  Good footwork for size, reliable at the second level.  Moves with the play and doesn't give up.  LSU's OL got blamed for the Bama game but he worked hard the entire time.  Shuffles in pass protection.  Footwork is sloppy and he crosses his feet.  Punch in pass protection is too narrow and he moves backwards behind it losing power.  Can get bumped off balance easily due to footwork.  Plays real close to the line to hide lack of kick slide.  Three year starter but seems raw in athleticism."
81,Elic Ayomanor,WR,Stanford,"Great route runner, big guy, bully.  Cracks people in the run game, like having an extra OL out there sometimes.  Decently explosive for size but makes up for it with crisp routes and good box outs.  Good body control in the air.  Runs two routes.  Doesn't really fool anyone doing them either.  Plays like a big body possession WR but doesn't have the hands of one.  Young and raw still.  Burst on to the scene with a massive game against Colorado in 2023 but just relatively reliable after that."
82,Harold Fannin Jr.,TE,Bowling Green,"All around TE.  Production king.  Great route running and really effective after the catch.  Has a toolbag of stiff arms and hurdles.  Great ball skills.  Snatches passes.  Real fearless when he's about to get blown up, stood in strong against Penn State's safeties hammering him.  Lined up everywhere and was main focal point of offense.  Zone killer.  Good blocker for his size, pushed people around although not as much in the A&M game against bigger DL.  A little short and slow, not too bad, more of a rumbler.  Faster in game than in the combine.  Can get pressed a bit.  Might not be able to block as effectively at the next level.  Kind of looks like a two down only guy and won't get the same focus he did in college."
83,Dylan Fairchild,OL,Georgia,"Mobile, strong left guard.  Pure wrestler.  Excellent hands.  Patient and precise.  Really hard to beat in a stand up fight.  Great leverage.  Very good mover, gets to the second level quick and effective in space.  Very smart.  All over the place in the pocket.  Great blocking off his hip, strong, puller and lead blocker.  Feet keep moving.  Resets well and keeps his anchor.  Seems more flash than effective when doing help blocks.  Way too late and tentative to actually help.  Kind of just throws his arms on combo blocks too, needs to get his feet under it.  Feet are happy and he resets a bit too soon, kind of nervous watching his pass pro reps.  Unclear why Ratledge and Fairchild were playing on their sides, both seem much better suited swapping."
84,Kyle Kennard,Edge,South Carolina,"Tall and built like a linebacker.  Gets off the snap fast, hits hard on initial step.  Really violent.  Uses his size well on the corner.  Gets around blockers with long arms and good angles.  Doesn't quit on a play.  Diagnoses the play well and tries hard.  Too tall for his build.  Either needs to put on weight or stunt his growth.  Pad level is practically standing up.  Really big but crummy against the run.  Was in college forever but seems raw in his athleticism.  Seems off balance at times."
85,Jamaree Caldwell,DL,Oregon,"Big fat nose tackle.  Built like a bowling ball and plays like one.  Surprising violence.  Fights like a demon.  Destroyed the senior bowl, couldn't be blocked.  Great first step for someone his size.  Great hand placement, stacks and sheds like a pro.  Decent at play recognition.  Plays overaggressive and can lose his gaps.  Not really a point of attack tackler, more of a help guy due to lack of wrap up ability.  Kinda mediocre."
86,Barrett Carter,LB,Clemson,"Best cover guy out of the LBs.  Pure man guy, can pick up any TE and can cover WRs.  Fast as hell in game but probably not in testing.  More fluid in his hips than pure top end speed.  Sticks people in tackles.  Pretty good blitzer.  Shoots well and pops guys.  Fights hard in the wash.  Not really a diagnose guy.  More reacts than makes plays.  Really poor angles on tackles even though he gets a lot of them, often loops behind guys.  Not really a pass rush guy, more of a gap shooter.  Small and stout, not super explosive."
87,Maxwell Hairston,CB,Kentucky,"Zone corner, fastest player in the draft at the combine.  Pick off machine two years ago.  Great zone sitter.  Triggers fast, picks off the ball at full momentum.  Pretty smart.  Processes routes into his zone well.  Dog mentality.  Plays really hard for a thin guy, gets his nose in on the run game, tries to make tackles even if he's not amazing at it.  Stiff.  Did Man but not very good at it.  Never played the slot, in deep zone in the outside, allowed to constantly shoot down with help over the top.  Terrible tackler.  Drag down only.  Grabby, both on and off the field.  Probably would let allegations go through before drafting him."
88,Elijah Arroyo,TE,Miami,"Great receiver.  Really good route runner for a bigger guy, looks pretty fluid.  Shields well.  Bullies at the point of the catch and doesn't let safeties get inside.  Smart player.  Looks for soft spots in the zone and sits in it.  Can get behind LBs fast.  Hurt a lot.  Kinda just runs after the catch, doesn't do anything special despite speed.  Not that strong in blocking.  Slow off the line."
89,Tate Ratledge,OL,Georgia,"Tall right guard.  Pretty great pass protector, probably should be a left guard.  Long arms, good length.  Hard to move, pretty strong and fights well.  Anchors and looks to stand up NTs in the pass rush.  Can pop guys in the run game but not consistent, more of a drive blocker.  Okay at getting to the second level, better blocking on his hip in pulls.  Kind of overrated as a finisher, a bit too tentative and lost in space.  Can lose his responsibility if runs aren't to his side.  Pad level is just way too high in run protection and not very strong when he gets low.  Loses his power on his bend.  Has an annoying tick where he fixes his facemask immediately after every play and I hate it."
90,Wyatt Milum,OL,WVU,"Tall RT playing at LT.  Really explosive.  Comes off the line and pops guys.  Hard to move.  Anchors great, fights violently.  Aggressive but not stupid, looks around and diagnoses before committing to blocks in pass pro.  Really good hands.  Knows how to place and convert power.  Pretty decent getting to the second level if its up his gap.  Stiff as a board.  Inconsistent knee bend and waist bend.  Held the crap out of Abdul Carter every play.  Knows when he's getting blown by laterally but can't do anything about it.  Balance issues when rushers get to his shoulder.  Probably a guard or a right tackle or anything but LT because he'll get your QB killed."
91,Jared Ivey,DL/Edge,Ole Miss,"Big edge, probably 5 tech.  Commands his space.  Long arms with fantastic hand placement.  Goes for a quick shed and then looks for the play.  Pretty good at manning the edge but bites on play actions a bit.  Can probably line up anywhere and doesn't necessarily have to come out of a three point stance.  Kind of stiff.  Not sure if his first step is slow or he's just tentative about giving up his gap assignment.  Can lose his gap when he gets an open lane so a little suspectible to RPOs.  Part of a stacked DL that gave him easy one on ones."
92,Jack Sawyer,Edge,Ohio State,"Backfield star.  Lots of effort.  Has a variety of pass rush moves and chains them together well.  Really good bull rush.  All upper body.  Strong hands.  Good stack and shed.  Plays without athletic technique.  Doesn't read the snap well and gets off slow.  Stick thin legs.  Doesn't really bend, gets the corner through fighting hard instead of using his length.  Not really a run defender but tries hard there.  Can get washed out against double teams."
93,Joshua Farmer,DL,Florida State,Intriguing pass rusher.  Great first step and really good swim move.  Chains pass rush moves well together.  Very violent.  Plays hard and nuts.  All flash and no substance.  Plays wild and easily gets washed out or picked up by better technique blockers.  Makes him a poor run defender despite his size and power.  Has super long arms but wastes them a lot with poor technique.  Engages too close at times and loses length.
94,Danny Stutsman,LB,Oklahoma,"Great downfield thumper.  Gets into the backfield fast, not just a gap plugger.  Strong in the wash.  Demands blocking assignments and can man his gap.  Really good blitzer.  Triggers fast and can diagnosis the open gap.  Okay in coverage.  Not really elite or a liability, just more of a drop back zone guy.  Decent athleticism and can cover the sidelines.  Not the greatest tackler for an ILB.  More of a gap shooter than a classic 4-3 ILB."
95,Korie Black,CB,Oklahoma State,"Press man corner.  Big guy, bullies.  Nice back pedal, especially out of press.  Sits well and keeps his feet under him, fluid and great technique.  Good initial pop but recovers and plays straight up isntead of just relying on physicality.  Nice lateraly agility, tracks well on slants.  Good speed for size, can keep up with vert routes well and shield the sideline.  Decent in run support and tries hard, turns back from the route to tackle underneath.  Generally hard to block too, just too strong.  Just okay in zone, way better tracking in man.  Doesn't try when sent on a hot blitz.  Tends to drift towards the LOS during a receivers routes and prob needs help over the top.  Sprinting out of his backpedal is slow, he crosses his legs too much and wastes time.  Grabs at the top of routes.  Eyes are usually on the receiver instead of the QB, INTs seem more luck than skill."
96,Isaac TeSlaa,WR,Arkansas,"Huge and tested out of his mind at the combine.  Unique slot WR or at least for traditional use in college football.  Tall and strong, blows people up that try to press him.  Plays like a TE, might convert there if he wasn't so athletically gifted.  Decent hands, boxes out great so doesn't really need them.  Runs like three routes and looks slow doing it.  Not nearly as explosive on the field as combine numbers suggest.  Barely produced but offense mainly went through Andrew Armstrong."
97,Nick Nash,WR,San Jose State,"Possession type WR.  Zone sitter, smart route runner that finds spots and knows when to cut off.  Converted QB.  Old, not very fast.  Displays some explosive ability and can bully on jump balls.  Runs like two routes.  Tiny hands.  Doesn't seem to affect him."
98,Luke Kandra,OL,Cincinnati,"Road grading right guard.  Big presence.  Gets wide and blocks downhill.  Surprising balance for blocking technique.  Leans very far forward but is fluid and agile for size.  Uses blitzers momentum well and carries them out of the play in pass pro.  Good help blocker and combo blocker.  Decent pass protection, fights well, keeps his feet.  Probably want to keep him against bigger NTs, loses to quicker DTs.  Pad level goes up and down randomly, seems to tip the play by how he engages.  Too high in pass pro too low in run pro.  Poor hand placement, lunges and grabs."
99,Shemar Stewart,Edge,Texas A&M,"Huge athletic freak.  Tall, fast, explosive.  Surprisingly good bend for size.  Lined up everywhere.  Really good hands, fights hard and nasty.  Pretty decent run defender.  Big enough and strong enough to fight for his gap assignment or set the edge.  Plays relatively hard.  Fantastic in Senior Bowl and Combine, terrible on the field.  Absolutely lost out there.  Doesn't know how to split double teams or get around them, just wastes time doing chopping steps.  Lack of hard play seems to be due to tentativeness rather than laziness.  Needs to just go out there and plaster guys as the play goes on.  Takes weird angles to the QB, needs to read the backfield better.  All potential, really low floor."
100,Kobe King,LB,Penn State,"Supreme run defending ILB.  Plays like a run defending edge.  Has great hands and pop off the snap to man gaps from a two point stance.  Reads the backfield great.  Can shed blocks like a defensive tackle.  Pushes pads and throws guys.  Not a coverage guy at all, seems like a two down guy.  Very slow.  Not a pass rusher despite backfield abilities, seems to be tentative or disciplined, unsure what he was asked to do at Penn State."
101,Mac McWilliams,CB,UCF,"Versatile man corner.  Smooth and fluid.  Great technique.  Destroyed the Senior Bowl, stuck everyone.  High IQ player, reads WRs well, reads the field well.  Mirorr ability is top notch.  Moves with WRs head fakes and shoulder fakes, very physical in man coverage.  Great zone ability too, tasked with it a lot.  Triggers fast, makes the tackle.  Gets into the backfield on runs to his side, just doesn't sit on blocks.  Kind of small and slight, tackle ability will probably make up for it.  Just mirrors the receiver in man coverage, doesn't anticipate like he does in zone.  Can get caught trying to mirror instead of breaking on the ball.  Limited production despite being thrown at a lot.  Ball skills are just mediocre.  Contains but doesn't take risks.  No hops.  Not as good at press as his teammate."
102,Bradyn Swinson,Edge,LSU,"Explosive edge.  Gets off the snap fast and pops blockers.  Great counter moves.  Seems to have the knack to set up blockers and shed them.  Really good hands, lands placement well to maintain length.  Pretty fast and agile.  Can trigger from his bend and generate a ton of power.  Kind of a selfish player, doesn't really man his lanes.  Just goes for the pass rush over and over.  RBs run right past him.  A bit too patient with his hand placement, can get stood up and waste time.  Should be able to defend the run but doesn't.  Gets washed out in double teams.  One year wonder and seems a bit raw."
103,Raheim Sanders,RB,South Carolina,"Bruising workhorse RB.  Lowers the shoulder and slams into people.  Great pad level, runs low and powerfully.  Great footwork.  Spry and nimble for a bruiser, resets well and delivers power from his legs.  Good use of stiff arm and trucking.  Fights hard on every yard.  Saavy behind the line.  Patient, finds the hole and bursts through it.  Surprising top end speed.  Can punish in the open field after the catch.  Okay blocker, tries.  Very punishing running style, constantly hit, often low.  Ran into the ground at Arkansas.  Goes into a jump cut when about to get tackled by bigger DL and loses his extra yards that he can get.  Can get cute behind the line and bounce outside instead of getting easy yards.  Really not that powerful at times when people hit his legs, just kind of goes down when he should run through it."
104,Bhayshul Tuten,RB,Virginia Tech,"Powerful two down RB.  Explosive runner and great receiver.  Great balance.  Takes hits well and keeps moving.  Great burst and top end speed, home run threat.  Threat out of the backfield in the passing game, catches the ball well and turns up field quick.  Did a bunch of kick returns before transfering from North Carolina A&T.   Fumbled a lot.  Not a pass protection guy, gets blown up.  Seems to get dinged up a lot with his style of running. Takes a lot of big hits."
105,Landon Jackson,Edge,Arkansas,"Tall, long edge.  Built powerfully.  Long strides, fights hard.  Crashes through plays and makes himself a force.  Decent bend and lateral movement for height.  Stick tackler.  Long arms, just wraps people and beats them with size.  Tries throughout the play, lots of chase downs.  Too tall.  Has to set deep and it makes his get off slower.  Loses his size advantage in edge setting and lets blockers command the area.  One pass rush move and its a dip.  Wastes movement sometimes by being tentative, needs to diagnose better."
106,Rylie Mills,DL,Notre Dame,"Big, tall NT.  Surprising athleticism, gets into the backfield quick.  Knows how to use his length, smart and active.  Good leg churn.  Fights throughout a play and drives guards over time.  No burst off the line, just leans into guys.  No pass rush moves.  Tore his ACL.  In college forever but doesn't seem capped out in power, but underpowered due to lack of burst."
107,Zy Alexander,CB,LSU,"Tall zone corner.  Fantastic press ability.  Uses his length well, strong.  Good body control.  Former QB and reads them well.  Great ball skills in combination of IQ and length.  Great tackler, one of the best in the class.  Wraps well, fights through blocks.  Pretty nice hips and footwork for height.  Doesn't get caught flat footed.  Somewhat decent at man coverage, raw but tries hard.  Slow as hell and should be a safety.  ACL tear.  Plays too tall.  Runs bow legged and seems to lack speed due to technique rather than sheer athleticism.  Can't jump.  Very slight and wins more on length than strength."
108,Justin Walley,CB,Minnesota,"All around, experienced CB.  Fluid athlete.  Great feet and hips.  Fast.  Triggers well, great start and stop.  Started for four years and it shows.  Just reads well.  Good in man and zone, better in zone.  Plays disciplined.  Doesn't take risks, plays in the receivers hip pocket.  Smaller guy but plays nasty.  Doesn't get bullied by bigger WRs, fights hard at the catch point.  Tries hard in the run game.  Shorter but built stout, aggressive, makes tough tackles.  Kind of just mediocre at man coverage, nothing special.  Not very twitchy, gets taken by shiftier guys.  Should be flagged more than he was.  A bit too patient at times and lets underneath catches happen.  Can't press, tries but can't do it.  Tore his MCL.  No hops, didn't do the vert at the combine for a reason."
109,Malachi Moore,Safety,Alabama,"Versatile safety, played all over the place despite size and athleticism.  Really smart, just knows the game.  Has the instincts and IQ to predict route patterns, play actions, etc.  Great at zone.  Solid tackler.  Fights hard and is a good fill defender against the run.  Not really that fast or agile, seems to move methodically but also tops out when trying to chase faster WRs down.  Hurt a lot.  Kind of just a guy despite aptitude, might struggle to play closer to the line or get the stats he got at Bama at the next level."
110,Shemar James,LB,Florida,"One of the better coverage guys in the draft.  Drops back with fluid hips.  Could possibly cover slot WRs.  Hits like a truck for his size.  Can thump in the lane.  Decent diagnoser, gets into gaps pretty quick.  Shoots gaps well too.  Not that fast or big.  Gets punked by OL if they get their hands on him.  Tackle ability is all about the power instead of technique."
111,Cam Skattebo,RB,ASU,"Shorter, squat RB.  Runs with great balance and patience.  Keeps feet churning, doesn't quit.  Used all over the place and in gadget plays.  Good vision, anticipates well and finds the lane.  Really good agility, quick feet and change of direction.  Bounces to the outside fast, not just a downhill runner.  Crazy stamina throughout the game.  Makes some crazy catches.  Tiny stature, just gets enveloped in plays.  Pure workhorse in one season, ran into the ground in redshirt senior year.  Style of running leads to some heavy hits.  Relies on incidental contact to break a lot of tackles, not anything special head on, can get wrapped up and stood up.  Won a lot on heart.  Can't pass protect, two down only guy."
112,Mitchell Evans,TE,Notre Dame,"Go up and get it TE.  Big and physical.  Bodies people on contested catches.  Strong hands.  Caught some crummy passes from Riley Leonard with good body adjustment.  Plus blocker, tries hard.  Hurt constantly.  Made of glass.  Doesn't really run routes, just goes out there.  Reliable somewhat as a blocker but doesn't dominate despite size.  Doesn't really cut in his route running, doesn't have the agility."
113,Chris Paul Jr.,LB,Ole Miss,"Smart play maker.  Great in coverage, processes fast.  Good footwork.  Can close quick and make a tackle or get into the backfield.  Triggers fast on the play and takes okay angles.  More of a momentum tackler than a thumper or technique guy.  Tries to make plays and misses assignment or just doesn't diagnosis the run well.  Kind of limited size.  Technique might not work at the NFL level."
114,Sai'vion Jones,Edge,LSU,"Playside edge.  Strong, long, powerful.  Superb run defender.  Plays downhill with a nose towards the football.  Just too powerful to keep out of the lane.  Defaults to his length and getting thin, not a ton of pass rushing moves but it works.  Surprising bend for a tall guy and great pad level.  Not the fastest athlete in the world but loping with a big presence.  Gets wide, becomes a nuisance, just always a force to deal with.  Has the little knack to split defenders or just be a problem.  Keeps arms wide and looks to swim over contact on the corner.  Good pursuit angles.  Does wear out but still tries hard.  Not a lot of technique.  Gets by a lot on his size right now.  Average get off on the snap.  Usually the last to move, counting tackles.  Loses power due to wide arm style.  Jump through is fun to watch but not sure how well its going to split double teams in the NFL.  Surprisingly not that good of stick tackling, wraps up but RBs seem to squirm out of it for extra yards.  Needs to be better at setting the edge in run defense if its going to be his calling card."
115,Ty Robinson,DL,Wisconsin,"Big bull rusher.  Surprising first step for build.  Good lane disruptor, decent length to defend run with one arm or bat passes.  Good motor.  Lots of experience, plays disciplined and finds plays.  Pad level varies, sometimes gets good length and sometimes gets held up easily.  Just bull rushes, has a rip too.  Poor technique, foot work gets wasted and hands go all over the place."
116,Nick Martin,Edge/LB,Oklahoma State,"Missile edge rusher.  Insane get off.  Gets into the backfield absurdly fast to make up for lack of strength.  Hard to stay in front of him, very wormy.  Great wrap up and drag down on tackles.  Gets dangerously close to hip drop tackles at times so he'll have to clean that up.  Okay in coverage.  Speedy and recovers well even if he isn't the stickiest or fastest at recognizing routes.  Tiny although has long arms for his height.  Went back to college for some unknown reason and wrecked his knee.  Lines up wide and shoots over and over, may not be allowed to do that at the next level.  Okay run defender but can be a liability if targeted."
117,Myles Hinton,OT,Michigan,"Quick LT.  Superb footwork.  Flies off the line and sets incredibly fast for a big man.  Shifty in general off the snap, works his way into a pass rusher like he's pass rushing.  Nice anchor at times with wide set.  Flashes brilliance getting to the corner at times and can shut it down hard.  Head on a swivel and looks for work, very active throughout play.  Decent climber, gets into space, could be better at making the block but is still there to do it.  Strong enough for college, technique kind of saps pure power.  More of a hand fighter.  Quick in the run game and engages fast even if he lacks functional strength to move people.  Technique is wild and odd.  Should probably just stick to what works great and learn to set the corner more.  Kick step sometimes faulters out of no where and he looks flat footed.  Hurt a lot.  Kind of grabby but got away with it a lot."
118,Smael Mondon Jr.,LB,Georgia,"Sideline to sideline athlete.  Great in coverage.  Patient, minds his zone well and then reacts.  Not sure if that's due to lack of play processing speed or technique.  Good tackler.  Sticks people.  Shoots well to make the play.  Decent in the backfield, good first step and can blitz off the edge or inside.  Hurt all the time.  Not really a full time pass rusher, more of a rangy player.  Played on a stacked defense where he wasn't asked to make the play that much."
119,Jeffrey Bassa,LB/Safety,Oregon,"Psychopath tackler that plays way bigger than his size.  Shoots fast.  Gets thin and is hard to block even though he lacks any pass rush moves.  Plays fluid and on his toes.  Very athletic for his size and can probably go back to playing as a big safety if he wanted to.  Allowed to play crazy because of stacked DL.  Tiny with tiny arms, raw as hell.  Converted safety and it shows."
120,Jason Marshall Jr,CB,Florida,"Taller man corner.  Great press technique.  Long arms, good bend, fluid out of the press.  Mirrors well for his height.  Good predictor.  High IQ player, just has the knack.  Low production but that's because he blankets guys.  Good ball skills, rakes well, punches well.  Nice shielding ability.  Good recovery a has good body control.  Jumps out the building, just explosive.  Okay zone guy, not as comfortable as when in man but athletic ability limits damage underneath.  Used more in man anyway.  A little stiff.  Footwork isn't that fast, more methodical than quick.  Doesn't try at all in run support.  Half hearted tackles.  Grabby.  Torn labrum, missed half the season."
121,Jarquez Hunter,RB,Auburn,"Fire hydrant back.  Hits the hole with speed and explosion.  Great vision.  Blows right through the line and looks for huge plays.  Shifts gears well.  Good use of jump cuts or just cutting and going.  Hard to take down.  Runs low and gets extra yards.  Holds the ball way too far out and fumbles.  Just runs forward and looks for incidental contact.  Not a third down back, can't pass block.  Just decent at receiving, nothing special."
122,Jake Briningstool,TE,Clemson,"Great route runner.  Tall, big target.  Lined up everywhere but probably best in the slot.  Pretty good at finding spots in zones.  Can punish after the catch.  Good hands.  Big and strong but plays so weak.  Lets people bully him off routes.  Can't block for whatever reason."
123,Ozzy Trapilo,OT,Boston College,"Mountain RT.  Plays with supreme size, gets his arms up quick and creates length.  Plays high but anchors well, has good timing.  Pretty powerful.  Drives guys in the run game and delivers good punch in pass protection.  Finishes to the ground on drive blocks.  Decent footwork for size, moves pretty quick and can pick up blocks in space.  Keeps his head on a swivel and looks for extra blocks.  Not that good at the kick slide and receives the punch in pass protection.  Sometimes more flash than effectiveness when doing a help block or out in space.  Hand placement seems random, inconsistent with which shoulder he's presenting in pass pro and gets took where he should win on length.  Can be susceptible to pass rushers crosshing his face.  A bit handsy.  Couldn't deal with fast guys at the Senior Bowl."
124,Jonah Savaiinaea,OL,Arizona,"Thick, squat RT.  Great punch and great help blocker.  Knocks guys around.  Pretty decent puller and lateral movement.  Gets out into space and moves well.  Okay footwork picking up blockers, doesn't get caught flat footed.  Strong arms.  Hard to beat him in a stand up fight.  Great leverage in seal blocks.  Got absolutely punked at the Senior Bowl, lost to everyone.  Blocking technique is guardlike moreso than a right tackle.  Gets too close and cheats up too close on the line.  Leverage is based off of initial step and then ends up getting too vertical.  Can get taken in open space in pass protection by the same moves he blanks closer to the line.  Should kick inside, has the potential to stick to RT but would be a much better guard."
125,Josaiah Stewart,Edge,Michigan,"Short pass rusher.  Sack machine rookie year.  Really smart, diagnoses plays quick, sets up blockers well.  Explodes off the snap, great timing.  Pure technician.  Great blend of athleticism and technique.  Had a great DL but contributed often at the point of attack.  Ok run defender if he gets a 1 on 1.  Built stout but a bit short, probably more of a 3-4 edge.  Has longish arms but can get overwhelmed by longer OTs.  Not a playside run defender.  Just shoots for the QB usually, either doesn't care about the run game or isn't really tasked to gap assignments on passing downs."
126,Aeneas Peebles,DL,Virginia Tech,"Pure three tech.  Has a nifty spin move.  Really quick off the line.  Sets people up and counters them hard.  Fights hard throughout the play and directs himself well towards the QB.  Decent run defender for a three tech, nothing special but not a liability.  Great pad level.  Has two pass rush moves.  Pretty tiny, gets washed out if focused.  Tested surprisingly bad at the combine, displayed better athleticism on the field.  In college forever."
127,Denzel Burke,CB,Ohio State,"Zone corner.  Smart, high effort athlete.  Sits and triggers.  Constantly playing downhill, great in run support and shallower routes.  Makes the tackle, can lay the shoulder and get some big hits.  Nice hips and feet.  Good lateral movement off the snap and mirrors well.  Instinctual player, has the knack.  Tries hard in man coverage.  Not good in man coverage.  Slow, might have to swap to safety.  A little undersized for how he plays.  Grabby and loses his instincts in man coverage.  Kind of slow, tested in the high 4.4s at the combine but slower on the field.  Poor change of direction.  Hurt constantly.  Has turned more into a tackler since his freshman year tape than a promising all around cover guy."
128,RJ Harvey,RB,UCF,"Dancing RB.  Exceptional footwork.  Moves great in traffic, quicker than everyone else on the field.  Great burst and top end speed.  Home run threat but also can lower the shoulder and take hits between the tackles.  Keeps the ball tight and secure.  Good pass catcher.  Smooth out of the backfield.  Stocky but tiny, blown up in pass protection.  Dances too much sometimes and creates the situations that he's good at instead of just running forward.  Two down rotation back, can't feature."
129,Savion Williams,WR,TCU,"Athletic freak.  Fast and jumps out of the building while being tall and decently strong.  Used as a gadget player at times.  Strong and chucks press coverage easily.  Long arms and big hands.  Explodes off the LOS.  Can't play WR worth a damn.  No hands, doesn't use frame well when catching the ball.  Routes are sloppy.  Doesn't try when blocking despite size, wasted effort.  Frustrating to watch."
130,Terrance Ferguson,TE,Oregon,"Dump off target for Bo Nix and Dillon Gabriel.  Pretty good route runner, good hands.  Tries hard in blocking, plays big and drives.  Can chuck with edges.  Tested decently fast at the combine but not exactly a blazer.  Decent athleticism in general, not terrible but not exciting.  Can play him on the line or out in space."
131,Simeon Barrow,DL,Michigan State,"Kind of slight pass rusher.  Plays smart.  Good hands and pad level.  Has decent pass rush moves, nothing special but can get loose.  Plays well against the point of attack and strong for his size.  Good in the backfield and can identify when the plays coming his way.  Kind of tiny and can get pushed if he doesn't get set.  Not the strongest in the world.  Can't really fight through stouter guards.  Tries too much in the hand fight instead of just disengaging and going."
132,Upton Stout,CB,WKU,"Smaller, nickel CB.  Incredible athlete.  Tested through the roof at the combine despite height.  Blew up the Senior Bowl, excelled in drills and in the game.  Amazing trigger ability.  Gets downfield fast, makes tackles.  Hits like a safety.  Fantastic technique.  Presses well despite size, uses longer than average arms to stay chest to chest and leverage WRs.  Good blitzer, good in the backfield in general.  Just hard to stay in front of for blockers due to height and strength.  Really decent game against Bama, made tackles against NFL sized players.  Height is an issue but makes up for it with hops and technique.  Great router to the sidelines.  Poor zone guy.  Slow recognition, poor timing.  Can get chucked off the line when the run goes to his side, had trouble in the BC game with that.  Poor technique on play break downs, gets in front of the receiver.  Can get driven off a route if he lands on the outside hip."
133,Jaxson Dart,QB,Ole Miss,"Mobile, shifty QB in a Lane Kiffin offense.  Shotgun, make a decision, throw it.  Great zip and accuracy, makes some effortless throws.  Big guy and mobile, doesn't get sacked too easily, can make plays with his feet.  Saavy after the snap due to designed QB runs, picked up some experience reading LOS's and making good shovel passes.  Generally good decision maker, finds open guys and hits them.  Tests the margins, bailed out by his receivers a lot but still puts them in a position to succeed.  Pretty tough runner, not the biggest guy in the world but uses his size to punish DBs.  Long, looping throw with a bit of a htich in it.  Decent enough footwork but seems to lose some consistency, specifically on timing throws across the middle.  Much better at leading a receiver vertically than horizontally.  Calm in the face of pressure but not smart, just dumps off.  Definitely seems to look at the LOS before looking down field, antsy in the pocket.  Just ducks into sacks if they're head on, doesn't hang tough to make the throw.  Running style is very physical and punishing.  Relies on improvisation and roll outs to find open lanes and seems to be more comfortable doing that than passing in the pocket.  Doesn't really seem to play with anticipation, throws to open guys instead of leading them open"
134,Xavier Restrepo,WR,Miami,"Short area quickness guy.  Runs solid routes and just gets open over and over.  Great contested catcher for his size.  Short but fights hard to make the catch.  Really smart.  Slow as hell, had a terrible 40 at his pro day.  Tiny catch radius, limited to having the ball put on him even though he tries on passes outside his radius.  Can't really block even though he tries."
135,Charles Grant,OL,William & Mary,"Mobile, fluid LT.  Just flows off the snap and looks effortless getting into gaps.  Gets to the second level fast.  Wide, hugging technique in pass pro.  Gets his hands on the outside shoulder and creates length.  Great footwork.  Built for zone blocking.  Keeps his head on a swivel and picks up second blocks.  Seems strong enough, but also lower level of play.  Seems to overset to the inside on run blocks and loses his gap assignment for seal offs.  This review has limited tape and is mostly based on highlights.  Hard to find negative plays."
136,Ajani Cornelius,OL,Oregon,"Tweening right tackle.  Only played there and has the length for it but looks and plays like a guard.  Nice lateraly footwork.  Kicks out well, can move in space.  Decent puller.  Long arms with a lean technique for engagement.  Functionally strong with decent ability to move defenders.  Not going to floor someone in a drive block but they will move.  Decent hand placement, attacks elbows well and contains.  Good anchor, blocks bull rushes well and can take on more impactful rushes.  Plodder getting to the corner in pass protection.  Relies more on length and going parallel to the sideline than quickness.  Not that great against more violent rushers.  Loses his hand placement over time and lets rushers get in his space.  Should really kick inside but not exactly a road grader or the best pass blocker, caught in flux."
137,Jared Wilson,Center,Georgia,"Solid pass blocker.  Fights well, stands up bull rushes.  Decently strong, wins more on leverage.  Good footwork, keeps his feet moving under him, doesn't get pancaked easily despite lighter frame.  Moves around in the pocket on help blocks.  Active.  Decent hands.  Lands his initial punch well enough.  Big enough to make a difference in the run game.  Generates decent enough push on his shoves.  Raw.  Looks panicked if he doesn't have a block right in front of him.  Doesn't deal with more violent NTs well.  Patient to a fault, kind of lets guys inside his pads.  More of a zone blocker than man.  Scheme limited until he puts on more muscle mass."
138,Omarr Norman-Lott,DL,Tennessee,"Rotational gap shooter.  Used just to explode into someone and create chaos.  Doesn't play a lot but destroys when he does.  Pure athleticism.  Extremely polished technically for someone with no experience.  Great hand placement, chains moves together, gets into the backfield fast.  Huge power for a small package.  Pops people.  Terrible tackler.  Gets hurt all the time.  Don't use him against the run.  Can't do it.  Elite third down rusher, not an every snap guy for a reason."
139,Sebastian Castro,Safety,Iowa,"Energetic box safety.  Plays hard, always around the ball.  Great trigger.  Undersized but hits hard and has really good wrap up.  Tested slow as hell at the combine but plays way faster in game.  Decently smart, diagnoses routes and running lanes well.  Great at the LOS for someone his size.  Patient and finds the lane.  Fast but limited top end speed.  More of a zone guy than anything else, possibly nickle corner.  Old as hell, was a special teamer for four years.  Just ok size, not small just not really going to thump people at the next level."
140,Chase Lundt,OT,Connecticut,"Tall RT.  Smooth pass protector.  Very nice kick step for a tall tackle.  Moves fluidly.  Good plant foot and strong anchor on the corner.  Shorter arms but uses them well, strikes to the chest plate and maintains throughout the play.  Good mover in space.  Run blocks well out in screens and pulling, finds second blocks.  Decent lean and balance in run blocking in general.  Just not very strong.  Anchor is there but can get absolutely flattened.  Limited arm length causes him to play without bend in pass pro.  Hand fighting is just okay against more violent pass rushers.  Doesn't seem to move anyone on help blocks or combo blocks.  Already 25, missed whole draft process due to injury."
141,Jordan James,RB,Oregon,"Shifty one cut back.  Decisive and explosive at the line.  Makes a cut and goes.  Quick feet, good short area quickness.  Decent vision, does get caught behind the line but generally good at finding the correct lane, not afraid to bounce it to the outside.  Efficient and no nonense when running, just goes forward.  Good stiff arm, decent contact balance when taken up low by defenders.  Smaller but good pop.  Can get extra yards and fall forward.  Puts his nose into pass blocking even if he's not going to floor anyone.  Plus receiver out of the backfield.  Hold your breath when he pass blocks he might die.  Pretends he's Ashton Jeanty with his presnap standing.  Balance is kind of poor against higher tackles and he's toppled easily.  Dances sometimes behind the line, only average cut back ability.  Feet stop churning when he gets hands on him.  Kind of small and not that strong despite weight, relies more on leverage than plowing anyone over."
142,Seth McLaughlin,Center,Ohio State,"Former Bama guy, went to OSU and played way better until he got hurt.  Taller center, good lower body.  Gets to the second level fast and lands big blocks.  Smart, good at identifying blitzes, help blocks and combo blocks well.  Decent lateral agility and can get up the B gap or pull.  Pretty good run blocker.  Gets hands in position well and fights hard.  Footwork lets him get into position fast.  Lighter but good motor.  Constantly tries.  Plays bolt upright and has no knee bend.  Just goes nose down and blocks on runs.  Much more intelligent in pass protection.  T-rex arms.  Achiles tear is concerning and could sap the diversity of his lateral movement game."
143,Chandler Martin,LB,Memphis,"Everything you want on the line except size.  Tiny but plays nasty.  Hits hard and fights relentlessly in the wash.  Has a weird knack for guessing playside runs and usually first at the point of attack.  Absurd amount of tackles for college.  Seems really smart but not that great in coverage.  Downhill guy only.  Not going to wow anyone with speed or athleticism.  Relies a lot on play intelligence over power, not sure where you play him."
144,Jonas Sanker,Safety,Virginia,"Coverage guy.  Smart player, recognizes routes well and picks them up with anticipation rather than just high energy.  Pretty decent run defender, uses his size and breaks down well.  Decently fast with a good trigger.  Can do single high duties.  Stiff as hell.  Skipped the agility drills at the combine for a reason.  Loses guys out of breaks because of his hips."
145,Isaiah Bond,WR,Texas,"Track star Alabama transfer.  Seems way faster in game than his score at the combine.  Pure burner, lined up everywhere and ran go routes.  Pretty decent route runner, doesn't just rely on speed.  Regularly bailed Ewers out on intermediate routes.  Pretty good hands and tracking ability.  Thin and no muscle.  Chucked easily.  Didn't really produce despite having a QB made to hit him deep.  Speed is elite but he doesn't really hide his go routes so safeties rotate in time."
146,Joshua Simon,TE,South Carolina,"Tall grad transfer from WKU.  Quick and fast receiving threat.  Good hands, good at finding spots in the zone.  Pretty nice after the catch, gets downfield quick and his hard to bring down.  Good balance and body control, adjusts well to passes, tracks the ball well.  Decent blocker in space.  Not really an in line blocker unless doing chip help.  Old already.  Not really a contested catch guy but creates enough separation to not worry about it too much.  Style of running might not break that many tackles at the next level."
147,Hollin Pierce,OT,Rutgers,"Mountain RT converted to LT.  Tall with long arms.  Supremely powerful.  Can move anyone in college football in the run game.  Bends completely at his waist but has to due to height.  Good anchor, sets feet wide and doesn't let smaller guys just get under him.  Gives up a lot of space in pass protection but doesn't get beat too often on pure bull rushes.  Long arms are a bit slow but ratchet after the block and move guys.  Surprisingly mobile with decent explosion.  Patient, doesn't over commit.  Hard worker and sticks throughout the play.  Terrible hand placement and can get took on spin moves.  Can't recover.  A bit too patient at times and lets guys get inside his chest.  Wears down a bit as the game goes on and isn't as devastating in the run game.  Pads he plays in are too high and look ridiculous.  24 already."
148,Miles Frazier,OL,LSU,"Versatile OL, mostly at guard, swapped to RG when Garret Dellinger got healthy and stayed there for two years.  Really good pass protector, wide stance, good length.  Anchors well against bull rushes.  Pretty smart, reads pass rushing intent before engaging.  Fights pretty well, keeps his feet and doesn't get wrenched.  Gets moved a bit but generally big enough to be an obstacle.  Decent run blocker when he gets push, has the strength to pop and keeps feet moving.  Okay on shorter pulls.  Can't move side to side.  Not a great help blocker, takes too long to get there.  Turns like a bus.  Not a second level blocker.  Tries but is too slow on processing more complex blitzes.  Blocks bolt upright."
149,Jalen Rivers,OL,Miami,"Former LG turned LT turned LG.  Great anchor.  Takes strong bull rushes and doesn't move.  Displayed it well at the Senior Bowl.  Good hands.  Strikes well but intelligent placement with more nuance for shiftier rushers.  Can get violent and nasty in run blocking.  Big shover, pops defenders and gets them off balance while creating seal blocks.  Poor bend.  Hurt all the time.  Slow feet, slow hips.  Played LT but not really suited for it.  Can get stacked and ripped due to bend issues.  Some issues blocking may be due to the QB behind him than his fault.  "
150,Jaylen Reed,Safety,Penn State,"Smaller of the two hard hitting Penn State safeties.  Faster so he played single high most of the time when they went into that formation.  Smart player, reads the field well, diagnoses well in the run game.  Sound tackler and pretty hard hitter.  Great special teamer.  Great in zone coverage.  Keeps his head on a swivel and picks up guys fast.  Kind of just average size, more of a help guy in run support than point of attack.  Not sure if asked to just attack the line or misses running lanes.  Not really a man cover guy, is tall but gets jumped over."
